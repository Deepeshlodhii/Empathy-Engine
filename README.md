# Empathy-Engine
The Empathy Engine is an emotion-aware text-to-speech system that detects sentiment from input text and generates expressive human-like speech. It dynamically modulates voice parameters such as pitch, speaking rate, and volume based on emotional state and intensity, enabling more natural and emotionally intelligent AI voice interactions.
