# 🎙️ The Empathy Engine – Emotion-Aware Text-to-Speech System

The Empathy Engine is an AI-powered service that converts plain text into emotionally expressive speech.  
Unlike traditional monotonic TTS systems, this project detects the emotion in the input text and dynamically modulates vocal characteristics such as pitch, speaking rate, volume, and prosody to produce more human-like and emotionally resonant audio output.

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis and modern neural TTS systems can be combined to build next-generation voice assistants for sales, customer support, and conversational AI.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/empathy-engine.git
cd empathy-engine
````

---

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Download NLTK Sentiment Model

Run once:

```bash
python
```

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
exit()
```

---

### 5. Configure TTS API

#### Option A – ElevenLabs

1. Create account: [https://elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Generate API key (enable "Text to Speech" permission)
3. Paste API key into:

```python
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

inside `tts_engine_elevenlabs.py`

(Optional: use `.env` for security)

---

#### Option B – Google Cloud TTS (alternative)

Follow Google Cloud TTS setup if ElevenLabs free tier is blocked.

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

```

Enter any text when prompted.

---

### Web Interface Version

```bash
python web_app.py
```

Open browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 🎛️ Design Choices & Emotion-to-Voice Mapping

### 1. Emotion Detection

We use **VADER Sentiment Analysis (NLTK)** to compute a compound sentiment score:

| Score Range | Emotion  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| ≥ 0.4       | Positive |
| ≤ -0.4      | Negative |
| Otherwise   | Neutral  |

The absolute value of the compound score is used as **emotion intensity**.

---

### 2. Voice Parameter Mapping Logic

Each detected emotion maps to a specific vocal configuration:

| Emotion  | Pitch  | Rate   | Volume / Stability | Speaking Style |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Positive | High   | Fast   | High energy        | Expressive     |
| Negative | Low    | Slow   | Softer             | Calm / serious |
| Neutral  | Normal | Normal | Balanced           | Neutral        |

---

### 3. Intensity Scaling

Emotion intensity dynamically controls how strong the modulation is:

Example:

| Text                           | Effect                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| "This is good."                | Slight pitch increase      |
| "This is the best day ever!!!" | Strong pitch + faster rate |

---

### 4. TTS Engine Choice

We selected **neural TTS (ElevenLabs / Google Cloud)** because:

* Supports pitch control
* Supports prosody
* Produces human-like voices
* Allows programmatic control
* Works with SSML
